			<h3 style="font-size:32px;" id="companypraisetitle">From Aspiration<br/>to Reality</h3> <br/>
			<p>Watching Mr.Sharif Mousallati LenoGulf chairman in Kano Nigeria ever since I can remember managing the commodities business. I was always intrigued to watch him dealing with farmers, (countless women sieve sesame), pick hibiscus flower, and sundry ginger. I wanted to follow his footsteps. I would watch the hardships of getting the commodities to our clients and the countless obstacles in each process of the trade. I always admired how much passion, endurance, patience, and dedication it took to trade and process commodities from farmer to end user.<span id="dots">.</span><span id="more">But what always lingered in the back of my mind is “how can we add value to our organisation, “how can we keep the farmer happy and the customer happy alike”, “what could be done to differentiate ourselves from the competition”. Having the opportunity to get a 1st class education in a 1st class country with work experience in both Sudan and Nigeria it was my goal to combine the best of both (world). The aim was to benefit our farmers, suppliers, organisation, team, and clients with an overall product/service superior to the norm. With all the above in mind, we redefined our strategy with our goals clearly identified into categories: supply, processing, logistics, and trading. We knew we had to identify and empower/enrich our premium farmers and supplier. Then upgrade our processing lines to include the best technology available immediately and upgrade according to international norms yearly. Logistics is always an obstacle that causes delays and frustration to us and our clients. So, we partnered up with pioneers (in land) logistics to increase our success in delivery time in receiving the commodities and similarly delivering the processed commodities to the port terminals. We also made vivid and outlined agreements with shipping companies to forecast our demand and allow them to supplier empty containers and booking priority. Finally, for the trading, we realised we need to be in a hub that facilitated the financial cycles and increase the confidence due to first-class banks and modern banking service. So we opened our company head office in the UAE and opened our company bank accounts with 1st class banks. However, we did not stop here, we continue to enhance the above processes with international accreditations, and certifications. We also have a solid long-term vision with concrete steps to grow the business to further our reach to more demanding clients. Our current expansions involve adding value to the commodities we trade. The aim is to empower our existing clients rather than compete with them. This is being done by further processing the commodities to allow us to send quality “added value” products to your existing clients so we both grow together. Finally, with the increase dependance on technology and automation, we have also partnered up with digital pioneers in Germany to build our private trading platform to connect our certified suppliers, and buyers.</span></p>
